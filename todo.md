TODO FILE FOR THE PROJECT
=========================

This file is a scratchpad for the project features. The convention is to add the feature as a list item and strike it out when it is complete. In case it doesn't seem like a good idea any more strike it out followed by a reason.

* ~~rename "shouldMatchJson" to "shouldContainJson"~~
* ~~should be able to do a complete match~~
* ~~all matchers should implement an interface and JsonMatcher should accept a list of them~~ -> Not applicable after simplifying the codebase
* fluent configuration object for supporting array includes or array in order comparison
